# zillow-scrape-rentals
This repository is an extention of an online tutorial hosted by [Tech in Real Estate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3qp7ANT_ik&ab_channel=TechinRealEstate)

This script allows users to scrape webpage data from Zillow.com and output a CSV file for spatial data manipulation in QGIS.
Please see the Jupyter Notebook hosted via Google Collab [here](https://github.com/archivestor/zillow-scrape-rentals/blob/main/Zillow_Rental%20Search.ipynb)

If you would like to know more about how I utilized this script, please read my Medium article [Can I walk There?](https://betterprogramming.pub/can-i-walk-there-network-analysis-for-los-angeles-b810f59f711c)

Thanks!
